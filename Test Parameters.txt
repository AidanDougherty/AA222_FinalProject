1: FFT, 5e3 freq pen, No Norm, rescaling, 1024 window, 75% overlap, 1 freq/note, random init, 0.1 mutation, 200 gen
2: FFT, 2e3 freq pen, No Norm, rescaling, 512 window, 50% overlap, 1 freq/note, random init, 0.01 mutation, 200 gen
3: same as 2, 0.1 mutation with new mutations
4: same as 3, approximation of target used for initial population
5: FFT, 2e3 freq pen, No Norm or rescale, 512 window, 50% overlap, 1 freq/note, approx init, 0.1 mutation, 200 gen
	- no overall duration mutation
6: Same as 5, no freq pen, 300 gen
7: same as 6, added note wav peak rescaling
8: same as above, in evaluation, added target_note_amp and note_amp normalization
9: same, fixed normalization, both at same scale, changed duration mutations to 50-150%
10. same, removed normalization
11. added rescaling with max factor of 2 ---- HUGE SUCCESS ------ SCIENCE!!!
12. same as above: FFT, no freq pen or norm, rescaling max 2, 512 window, 0.5 overlap, 1 freq/note, approx init, 0.1 mutation, 200 gen
	- added overlap note removal after mutation, remove any left-overlapping notes
13. same as above, but changed overlap removal to spacing out left-overlapping notes
14. back to 11, remove overlap at end
